Hi,

A DB of 2 categories is created: Fruit and meat. 
A brief description of the file:
The application is developer using Python with the IDE PyCharm 3.8
The database is desgined in PostgresSQL, it has two tables; #category_table" and "product_table".
The Application tab needs to be run and in the Run console, an IP address will be generated.
Click on the IP which is the localhost IP and it will take you to a "Welcome" page. 
In the URL you can manipulate the database using the following operations: "getallcategories", "create", "update", "delete".
The CRUD operates can be applied to the "categories" and the "products" and the values returned are jsonified
